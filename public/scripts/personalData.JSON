Tommy is also a lover of all types of music but not many people know that on a good day customers can get serenaded by him while he makes their delicious lobster rolls. One thing is for sure, Tommy's fun competitive spirit is definitely what makes customers visits to Luke's in Georgetown one of a kind. "
