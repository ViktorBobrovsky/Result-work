Tommy is also a lover of all types of music but not many people know that on a good day customers can get serenaded by him while he makes their delicious lobster rolls. One thing is for sure, Tommy's fun competitive spirit is definitely what makes customers visits to Luke's in Georgetown one of a kind. "

Customers can come to expect similar chemistry in the kitchen of Luke's DC. Pass. Shoot. Score. (by Bryan)"

One of the newest member to join the Dukes of Luke’s, he has much to learn about perfecting the Famous Lobster Rolls everyone has come to love. In his spare time (mainly before work) he loves to camp out in Central Park and feed the birds while absorbing vitamin D from the sun. His favorite thing to do at Luke's is buttering and spicing, he may even, but some may have other opinions. All in all, Tristan's a cool dude. Stop by Luke's sometime and he just may give you a speech that can change your life... or just butter and spice your taste buds. (by Please)"

While she has formally requested there be no Sound of Music references, we insisted on including a list she turns to when feeling down: Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, Haribo gummies and scarves that keep twistin', Leftovers in the fridge tied up with string, These are a few of Maria's favorite things. Oh and David Duchovny. David, if you're reading this, please call. "

It’s like someone sewed two baseball gloves onto a large child. But seriously, we have to special order gloves for the guy. Thanks,"
