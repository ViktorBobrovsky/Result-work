							<h1>LOBSTER ROLL (320 CALORIES), CRAB AND SHRIMP ROLLS (340 CALORIES)</h1> 
							<i>As a result of the following practices, Maine lobster landings have tripled over the last twenty years, and Maine lobster is certified sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council. </i>
							<br/>
							<br/> 

							<ul>
								<li>Maine has both minimum and maximum size restrictions for lobsters that can be caught. The size is determined by measuring the length of the carapace, the shell that covers the main body. Shorter than 3.5 inches and the lobster is too small; longer than 5 inches and the lobster is too big.</li>

								<li>Undersized lobsters are thrown back because they haven’t had a chance to reproduce yet; oversized lobster are thrown back because they can produce exponentially more eggs than smaller lobsters, meaning they contribute more to the population.
								</li>

								<li>Lobstermen throw back female lobsters bearing eggs, and put a v-notch in the lobsters’ tails. Then, if that lobster is ever caught again without eggs, it still cannot be kept, as it is marked as a fertile breeder.</li>

								<li>Lobster traps are required to have juvenile vents, so small lobsters can escape and not risk being killed by larger lobsters in the trap.</li>

								<li>Lobstermen are limited to a maximum of 800 lobster traps per commercial fisherman.</li>

								<li>Licenses for the Maine lobster fishery are closed, so no new lobstermen may start lobstering until others retire.</li>

								<li>Lobster licenses are tied to one individual and one boat, so the lobsterman must be on board at all times, keeping corporations from owning lobster fleets and ensuring that industry money stays in the coastal communities where lobstermen live and work.</li>
							</ul>

							<h1>LOBSTER ROLL (320 CALORIES), CRAB AND SHRIMP ROLLS (340 CALORIES)</h1> 
							<i>In contrast to Maine, each Canadian province is regulated slightly differently, but all fisheries we source from abide by the following rules. As a result of these practices, Canadian lobster is certified sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council in the three provinces where we buy: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Quebec.</i>
							<br/>
							<br/> 

							<ul>
								<li>Both minimum and maximum size restrictions for lobsters that can be caught. (In Canada the size restrictions vary by province).</li>

								<li>Undersized lobsters are thrown back because they haven’t had a chance to reproduce yet; oversized lobster are thrown back because they can produce exponentially more eggs than smaller lobsters, meaning they contribute more to the population.
								</li>

								<li>Lobstermen must throw back female lobsters bearing eggs, and may voluntarily put a v-notch in the lobsters’ tail. Then, if that lobster is ever caught again without eggs, it still cannot be kept, as it is marked as a fertile breeder.</li>

								<li>Lobster traps are required to have juvenile vents, so small lobsters can escape and not risk being killed by larger lobsters in the trap.</li>

								<li>Lobstermen are limited to a maximum of 800 lobster traps per commercial fisherman.</li>

								<li>Licenses for the Maine lobster fishery are closed, so no new lobstermen may start lobstering until others retire.</li>

								<li>The Canadian lobster fishery works on open and closed seasons, so there are many times of year when lobster cannot be caught, reducing fishing pressure on the population.</li>
